# WeatherApp

This weather application uses a server side api to be able to find the weather for any city and be able to give you the forecast for the next 5 days. I belive the layour is overall very user friendly with nothing being hidden behind any drop down menus or anything. entering a city and clicking search shows you the weather data for the next 5 days from the city entered, it'll also provide you with the name of the city to the left of the search button showing that it is saved in the local storage. searching more cities will make more cities show up next to the search and to make things even simpler, clicking on one of those search cities will make it so that you can see the weather data from that city, and if everything starts to feel too cluttered you can easily click the clear history button to clear the cities next to the search button. Below I have provided you with the link to the deployed applicaiton and a screenshot of the deployed website
